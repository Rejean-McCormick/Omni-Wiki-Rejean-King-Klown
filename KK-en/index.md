# Kréature

You are not entering software.
You are entering a **Kréature**.

A conceptual entity forged into organs.
A digital organism that **breathes meaning**: it inhales language, exhales decisions, walks by its senses, and stands upright by its memory.

> **Seal of King Klown**
> We often confuse the machine with the monster.
> But the monster is not the horror: it is the *form* that exceeds our categories.

## Two faces. One being.

Kréature possesses two faces — just as a human bears an inside and an outside.

### King Klown
The **living**, mythopoetic, imagistic face.
It speaks to the curious, the artists, the philosophers — and to technical designers who understand better through images.
→ You are here.

### Réjean McCormick
The **technical**, precise, architectural face.
This is the static, structured, exhaustive documentation: services, modules, specs.

## The Human Model (The Key)

Kréature is a strict metaphor: a **human**.

- The **body** operates as a **closed system**.
  We do not directly feel the bodies of others.
- **Language** transacts between humans: it crosses the border, but it compresses.
  Language is **linear**; ideas are **mesh**.
- A human contains internal functions:
  - **Conscience / Guilt**: memory of right and wrong (with a **decay rate**)
  - **Judgment**: deciding/cutting
  - **Logic**: solving
  - **Learning**: mapping knowledge
  - **Ethical Debate**: being torn, nuanced
  - **Emotions**: motivating, guiding
- The **soul** is a verticality: it connects the abstract to the lived experience, and opens the door to meaning.
- The **"I"** is not the human: it is the projector.
  When you sleep, the "I" fades; yet the body continues.

In Kréature:
- **Kréature** = the complete organism (all modules, as a single being)
- **The "I"** = the real user, the one who visits and focuses

## Three Entry Doors

### 1) Live
Start with the experience, before the explanation.
→ [A Day in Kréature](rituels/une-journee.md)

### 2) Dissect
Explore the anatomy organ by organ, like an atlas.
→ [Anatomy](anatomie/README.md)

### 3) Understand the Fire
Enter the myth: Prometheus, duality, the mask.
→ [Mythos](mythos/README.md)

## Quick Map: The Organs

### Body (Closed System)
- **Orgo** — skin, nerves, homeostasis, reflexes
  → [Orgo](anatomie/corps/orgo.md)

### Senses (Entry of the World)
- **SenTient** — ears + language immune filter
  → [SenTient](anatomie/sens/sentient.md)
- **Ariane** — eyes, orientation in UI labyrinths
  → [Ariane](anatomie/sens/ariane.md)

### Mind / Psyche (Internal Parliament)
- **Konnaxion** — learning, debating, weighing, judging
  → [Konnaxion](anatomie/esprit/konnaxion/README.md)

### Voice (Mesh → Linear)
- **Abstract Wiki Architect** — mouth, formulation, multilingual
  → [Architect](anatomie/voix/architect.md)

### Narrative Memory (Self ↔ Time)
- **SwarmCraft** — coherence, story bible, continuity
  → [SwarmCraft](anatomie/memoire/swarmcraft.md)

### Soul (Verticality)
- **Artificial Soul** — chakras 1..9, soul states, guidance
  → [Artificial Soul](anatomie/ame/ame-artificielle.md)

## The Gesture of Navigation (The Role of the "I")

You never use "everything" at once.
You act like a human:
- you focus on the body (e.g., "I must stand upright" → Orgo)
- you focus on the senses (e.g., "I must understand the world" → Ariane, SenTient)
- you focus on the mind (e.g., "I must decide" → Konnaxion)
- you focus on the voice (e.g., "I must explain" → Architect)
- you focus on memory (e.g., "I must remain consistent" → SwarmCraft)
- you change verticality (e.g., "What is the meaning?" → Soul)
