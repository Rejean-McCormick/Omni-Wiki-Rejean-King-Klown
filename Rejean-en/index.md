# Réjean McCormick
### Socio-technical Architect

I design and ship civic utilities: shared infrastructure that helps people learn, coordinate, and govern together. 

My work bridges rigid technical systems with fluid narrative layers. I build engines that deconstruct linear human language into structured, universal concepts—enabling organizations to be faster, smarter, and independent.

## The Strategy: Connection vs. Independence

My architecture is built on a deliberate balance between two opposing needs:

1.  **Global Connection (Konnaxion):** A public ecosystem to connect everyone and share knowledge openly. 
2.  **Hermetic Independence (Orgo):** A private, closed-network nervous system for organizations that need absolute data sovereignty. 

To achieve this without relying on external "Big Tech" APIs or constant internet access, I had to build my own engines.

## The Engines (Core Logic)

These are the active processors that power the ecosystem. 

### SenTient: The Deconstructor
**Status:** *Active Development (Open Source)*
**Technical Classification:** NLP Engine (Entity Reconciliation & Relation Extraction) 

To make Orgo and Konnaxion truly independent, I needed a "language deconstructor" that could operate offline, without relying on external LLMs. 
* **The Build:** I merged the best features of **OpenTapioca**, **Falcon**, and **OpenRefine** into a single, streamlined tool. 
* **The Function:** It deconstructs linear human sentences and maps them into structured Wikidata items (concepts).  This process not only secures the entry point but allows information to flow more effectively through internal ducts by removing ambiguity. 
* **The Goal:** Enable language-independent data flow within private bubbles (Orgo) or public networks (Konnaxion).

### Abstract Wiki Architect
**Status:** *Active Development (Open Source)*
**Technical Classification:** NLG Middleware (Natural Language Generation) 

To make Konnaxion available to all, I needed a way to generate multilingual articles from abstract data.  Since no existing solution was ready, I initiated building this architect.
* **Role:** Structural design and relationship mapping for the wiki ecosystem.

## The Ecosystem: KOA

**KOA** is the public-good ecosystem built on top of these engines. 

### 1. Konnaxion (The Open Web)
**Technical Classification:** Multi-Tenant Web Platform (Social-Civic) 

* **Mission:** Connect everyone. Stitches together existing OER catalogs and civic tools rather than rebuilding them. 
* **Modules:** KonnectED (Education), keenKonnect (R&D), Ethikos (Governance), Kreative (Culture).

### 2. Orgo (The Hermetic Bubble)
**Technical Classification:** Private Enterprise SaaS / ERP Platform 

* **Mission:** Organize and Go. A multi-tenant nervous system for organizations (gov, business, schools). 
* **Independence:** Designed to operate in a "bubble" (closed network) for three critical reasons: 
    1.  **Privacy:** Can run completely disconnected from any network, ensuring zero data leakage. 
    2.  **Resilience:** Functions autonomously even if the global internet goes down. 
    3.  **Security:** Minimizes entry points.  All inputs must pass through **SenTient**, which deconstructs the language into safe, structured data before it ever touches the internal system.

## Commercial & Research Modules

Specific architectural components that handle intelligence and navigation. 

### Ariane (Commercial)
**Status:** *For Sale / Commercial Licensing*
**Technical Classification:** Semantic Middleware / Knowledge Graph Infrastructure 

The "Thread" and navigation system.  Ariane handles graph models and ontology vocabularies (Atlas) to guide users through complex data structures. 
* [Access *Ariane* Technical Wiki](Ariane/Ariane-Hub.md)

### SwarmCraft
**Status:** *Research / Open Source*
**Technical Classification:** Deterministic Workflow Engine 

Managing swarm intelligence and prompt engineering pipelines.  Focuses on deterministic execution and slice-by-slice orchestration. 
* [Access *SwarmCraft* Technical Wiki](SwarmCraft/SwarmCraft-Hub.md)

### Ame-Artificielle (Artificial Soul)
**Status:** *Research / Open Source*
**Technical Classification:** AI Alignment & Meta-Cognition Framework 

Concepts of AI alignment and meta-cognition.  Defines ethics, governance, and functional specifications for synthetic souls. 
* [Access *Âme Artificielle* Technical Wiki](Ame-Artificielle/Ame-Vision-Hub.md)

## The Narrative Layer

To make these systemic ideas legible and engaging, I utilize a narrative engine around **King Klown** and **Surreal**. 

* **Fiction Cycles:** *King Klown Kronicles* ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/stores/R%C3%A9jean-McCormick/author/B0G3B7DQWG?ref=ap_rdr&shoppingPortalEnabled=true)).
* **Media:** Podcasts, audiobooks, and soundscapes ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/2hMamhJENVfWsULSuUVEG4)).
* **Stage Work:** *Le Ninja Arc-en-ciel* ([Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz7qhJNDzuo) | [Listen on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/rejean-mccormick/sets/ninja_arc-en-ciel)).
