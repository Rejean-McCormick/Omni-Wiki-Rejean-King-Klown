### Socio-technical Architect

[cite_start]I design and ship civic utilities: shared infrastructure that helps people learn, coordinate, and govern together. [cite: 640]

My work bridges rigid technical systems with fluid narrative layers. [cite_start]I build engines that deconstruct linear human language into structured, universal concepts—enabling organizations to be faster, smarter, and independent. [cite: 641]

## The Strategy: Connection vs. Independence

My architecture is built on a deliberate balance between two opposing needs:

1.  [cite_start]**Global Connection (Konnaxion):** A public ecosystem to connect everyone and share knowledge openly. [cite: 643]
2.  [cite_start]**Hermetic Independence (Orgo):** A private, closed-network nervous system for organizations that need absolute data sovereignty. [cite: 644]

[cite_start]To achieve this without relying on external "Big Tech" APIs or constant internet access, I had to build my own engines. [cite: 645]

## The Engines (Core Logic)

[cite_start]These are the active processors that power the ecosystem. [cite: 646]

### SenTient: The Deconstructor
**Status:** *Active Development (Open Source)*
[cite_start]**Technical Classification:** NLP Engine (Entity Reconciliation & Relation Extraction) [cite: 1131, 1138]

[cite_start]To make Orgo and Konnaxion truly independent, I needed a "language deconstructor" that could operate offline, without relying on external LLMs. [cite: 647]
* [cite_start]**The Build:** I merged the best features of **OpenTapioca**, **Falcon**, and **OpenRefine** into a single, streamlined tool. [cite: 648]
* [cite_start]**The Function:** It deconstructs linear human sentences and maps them into structured Wikidata items (concepts). [cite: 649] [cite_start]This process not only secures the entry point but allows information to flow more effectively through internal ducts by removing ambiguity. [cite: 650]
* [cite_start]**The Goal:** Enable language-independent data flow within private bubbles (Orgo) or public networks (Konnaxion). [cite: 651]

### Abstract Wiki Architect
**Status:** *Active Development (Open Source)*
[cite_start]**Technical Classification:** NLG Middleware (Natural Language Generation) [cite: 3, 21]

[cite_start]To make Konnaxion available to all, I needed a way to generate multilingual articles from abstract data. [cite: 652] Since no existing solution was ready, I initiated building this architect.
* [cite_start]**Role:** Structural design and relationship mapping for the wiki ecosystem. [cite: 654]

## The Ecosystem: KOA

[cite_start]**KOA** is the public-good ecosystem built on top of these engines. [cite: 655]

### 1. Konnaxion (The Open Web)
[cite_start]**Technical Classification:** Multi-Tenant Web Platform (Social-Civic) [cite: 10, 656]

* **Mission:** Connect everyone. [cite_start]Stitches together existing OER catalogs and civic tools rather than rebuilding them. [cite: 656]
* [cite_start]**Modules:** KonnectED (Education), keenKonnect (R&D), Ethikos (Governance), Kreative (Culture). [cite: 657]
* **[Official Site (konnaxion.com)](https://konnaxion.com)**
* **[Presentation of Konnaxion (formerly "Knowledge Hub") (kingklown.wiki)](https://kingklown.wiki/)**
* [Access *Konnaxion* Technical Wiki](Konnaxion/Konnaxion-Hub.md)

### 2. Orgo (The Hermetic Bubble)
[cite_start]**Technical Classification:** Private Enterprise SaaS / ERP Platform [cite: 1073, 1084]

* **Mission:** Organize and Go. [cite_start]A multi-tenant nervous system for organizations (gov, business, schools). [cite: 658]
* [cite_start]**Independence:** Designed to operate in a "bubble" (closed network) for three critical reasons: [cite: 659]
    1.  [cite_start]**Privacy:** Can run completely disconnected from any network, ensuring zero data leakage. [cite: 659]
    2.  [cite_start]**Resilience:** Functions autonomously even if the global internet goes down. [cite: 660]
    3.  [cite_start]**Security:** Minimizes entry points. [cite: 660] [cite_start]All inputs must pass through **SenTient**, which deconstructs the language into safe, structured data before it ever touches the internal system. [cite: 661]

## Commercial & Research Modules

[cite_start]Specific architectural components that handle intelligence and navigation. [cite: 662]

### Ariane (Commercial)
**Status:** *For Sale / Commercial Licensing*
[cite_start]**Technical Classification:** Semantic Middleware / Knowledge Graph Infrastructure [cite: 243, 245]

### SwarmCraft
**Status:** *Research / Open Source*
[cite_start]**Technical Classification:** Deterministic Workflow Engine [cite: 1184, 1236]

[cite_start]Managing swarm intelligence and prompt engineering pipelines. [cite: 665] [cite_start]Focuses on deterministic execution and slice-by-slice orchestration. [cite: 665]

## The Narrative Layer

[cite_start]To make these systemic ideas legible and engaging, I utilize a narrative engine around **King Klown** and **Surreal**. [cite: 667]

* **Fiction Cycles:** *King Klown Kronicles* ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/stores/R%C3%A9jean-McCormick/author/B0G3B7DQWG?ref=ap_rdr&shoppingPortalEnabled=true)).
* **Media:** Podcasts, audiobooks, and soundscapes ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/2hMamhJENVfWsULSuUVEG4)).
* [cite_start]**Stage Work:** *Le Ninja Arc-en-ciel* ([Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz7qhJNDzuo) | [Listen on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/rejean-mccormick/sets/ninja_arc-en-ciel)). [cite: 669]
